### - For eg, consider this statement->  welcome: Hello there! I will take your survey. 
###   Here 'welcome' is the KEY and content after the colon(:) is the VALUE.
### - You are free to change the VALUE.
### - Please DO NOT change the KEY. It will create a disaster. 
### - Make sure to write complete sentences and have a full-stop/question-mark at the end of the response.
